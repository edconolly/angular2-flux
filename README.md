Angular2: Flux and Observable Example
=====================================

This example shows how to implement the flux pattern in Angular 2 using observables.

It's accompanied by a blog post to run through the implementation.

You can read the post on the [ovo tech blog](http://tech.ovoenergy.com/angular/angular2/2015/11/20/Angular2-Flux-Observables.html).

Getting Started
---------------
Make sure you have the typescript compiler installed (`npm install -g tsc`).

Install all the dependencies with 
```
npm install
```

Then, in one window run the compiler in watch mode on the `src/` directory.
```
tsc -p src -w
```

In another window start the app with
```
npm start
```
